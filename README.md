# Exploring Factors That Affect The Financing Of College Sports
 
## Introduction
- To explore the question of what factors effect the financing of college sports, I decided to look into some key elements that is unique to every university, including tuition, athletic conferences, and endowments. This topic is particularly interesting to me as it combines my two of my main interests in life, which are athletics and statstics. I have played sports since I was young and as playing college sports has always been a dream of mine. As it is coming true next year, it is becoming more important to me to learn about athletics programs at univisities, especially state schools that don't appear to have as much money as smaller schools, yet somehow generate massive atheltic departments. 
- Through my research, I attempted to answer the 3 questions that follow: Does a school’s tuition directly correlate to how much money they pour into their athletics programs? Do the specific conferences that schools are a part of correlate to the amount of money their athletics programs receive (example of a conference is Big 10)? How largely do endowments contribute to the money given to the athletics of a school? 

## Methods
- The data contained within this set includes the revenues/expenditures of over 234 Division I public universities. It attempts to explain the ways in which these schools pay for their large athletics programs, by showing the breakdown of finances of each school. The dataset comes from the collaboration between The Huffington Post and The Chronicle of Higher Education, which has covered the crossroads between college sports and academia for many years. I have permission to use this dataset from the owner because in the article that was written preceding the data, the author wrote that he encourages everyone to look at the data in order to tell their own stories about college sports subsidies, and the things that colleges give up to further their athletic programs.  

1. I could investigate how a school’s tuition affects the money given to their athletic programs by looking at both the instate and out of state tuition (as all schools are state-schools on the list) and looking at the money given to the athletics programs. Then with this information, I could create a ranking of the schools with the highest tuition and compare it to a list of the schools with most funded athletics programs, which would allow me to look at this question. In order to do this, I would need to know the tuition of the school for both in and out of state, and I would also need to know the funding of the athletic programs of the school. Some pseudocode would include, first creating lists that hold the endowments of each school and the athletic funding of each school (each index should be the same school for both lists) - may need a counter list of the schools. Then create a list that looks at the school with the highest endowments and determines where on the list the school’s athletic funding is (if the school with the biggest endowment has a ranking of 230/234 for athletic funding - it probably does not affect it). Then, somehow create a list that compares these two variables to look at - and ultimately determine if it looks like they are related. 
2. I could look at if a conference affects the money given to the athletics programs by finding the rankings of funding to athletic departments for each conference and comparing the highs and the lows from each list to each other. In order to determine this, I would need to look at the conference that each school is a part of, and also know the athletic funding each school is given. In order to do this, I could create various lists, one for each conference. Then I could look at the highs of each list in comparison to each other, and then determine if the conference with the highest paying programs also has the highest average among all the schools. 
3. Finally, I could look at how endowments affect the money given to athletic teams doing a similar thing that could be done for tuition, which is finding the endowment of a school and comparing it to the funding of the athletic departments per school. In order to investigate this question, I would need to know the endowments for each school as well as the athletic funding the programs are given. In order to answer this question, I could first create a list of endowments per school and create a list of the funding of each athletic program (where each index represents a specific school) - may need a counter list of the schools. Then, look at which schools have the highest endowments and determine how much funding their schools receive - using this information can create a list of the schools endowments (ranking from highest to lowest) and look at how much schools with large endowments are giving to athletics in comparison to those with small endowments (somehow - not exactly sure how to compare). Using this information, can answer the question asked.
