# Exploring Factors That Affect The Financing Of College Sports
 
## Introduction
- To explore the question of what factors effect the financing of college sports, I decided to look into some key elements that is unique to every university, including tuition, athletic conferences, and endowments. This topic is particularly interesting to me as it combines my two of my main interests in life, which are athletics and statstics. I have played sports since I was young and as playing college sports has always been a dream of mine. As it is coming true next year, it is becoming more important to me to learn about athletics programs at univisities, especially state schools that don't appear to have as much money as smaller schools, yet somehow generate massive atheltic departments. 
- Through my research, I attempted to answer the 3 questions that follow: 
    - Does a school’s tuition directly correlate to how much money they pour into their athletics programs? 
    - What conferences have the highest average support, and what conferences have the lowest? Does this follow my prediction that leagues with better ranked teams will have more money?
    - How largely do endowments contribute to the money given to the athletics of a school? 

## Methods
- The data contained within this set includes the revenues/expenditures of over 234 Division I public universities. It attempts to explain the ways in which these schools pay for their large athletics programs, by showing the breakdown of finances of each school. The dataset comes from the collaboration between The Huffington Post and The Chronicle of Higher Education, which has covered the crossroads between college sports and academia for many years. I have permission to use this dataset from the owner because in the article that was written preceding the data, the author wrote that he encourages everyone to look at the data in order to tell their own stories about college sports subsidies, and the things that colleges give up to further their athletic programs.  

1. I investigated how a school’s tuition affects the money given to their athletic programs by looking at both the instate tuition (as all schools on the list are state-schools) and looking at the money given to the athletics programs. Then with this information, I created a list of the schools with and their instate tuition and compare it to a list of the the funding of the schools athletics programs. After doing this, I used the correlation coefficient to determine the how correlated tuition and athletic funding is. In order to do this, I needed to know the tuition of the school and the funding of the athletic programs of the school. This allowed me to determine that tuition and funding have a correlation coefficent of... which means that...
2. I looked at if a conference affects the money given to the athletics programs by finding the average funding to athletic departments for each conference and comparing them to each other. In order to determine this, I would need to look at the conference that each school is a part of, and also know the athletic funding each school is given. I created a list of averages, each index representing each conference. Then I manually determined the conference with the highest and lowest average fundings, and put the entire list into an order. This allowed me to determine if there is really a correlation between the rankings of the schools that a conference encompasses and the average funding of those conferences as I suspected. 
3. I looked at how endowments affect the money given to athletic teams doing a similar thing as I did to determine the correlation between tuition and funding. In order to investigate this question, I would need to know the endowments for each school as well as the athletic funding the programs are given. I first created a list of endowments per school and a list of the total funding of each athletic program (where each index represents a specific school). Then I used the correlation coefficent to determine how closely endowment and funding are related.
